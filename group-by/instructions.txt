Create a function called "groupBy" that takes an array as the first argument and a string as the second.  The array passed as the first argument should be an array of objects.  If the second argument string matches a propety name of an object, it will use the property value as the property key in the returned object.  The value of that new property key will be the original objects that were passed into the function, grouped by the specified property.
